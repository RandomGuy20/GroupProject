                Circuit Solutions was dounded by a couple fo tech enthusiasts who noticed a 
                significant gap in reliable tech support in Orlando. We saw an opportunity to create 
                a space where anyone, from elders needing a helping hand with their devices to the younger generation 
                passionate about RGB setups and gaming gear, could find the support they needed.               
            </p>

            <p class="bright-blue mid-font">
                By placing ourselves in the heart of Orlando we made it our mission to be easily accessible to all. 
                We pride ourselves on being a welcoming hub for tech users of all ages and skill
                levels.
            </p>
